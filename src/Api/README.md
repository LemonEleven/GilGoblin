## GilGoblin.Api

`GilGoblin.Api` is a package that hosts a REST API which users can query to get data from the video game Final Fantasy
XIV (FFXIV). It allows querying for item information, prices, recipes, and most importantly, the most profitable recipes
for crafting

This package is only the REST API and is intended to be used in conjunction with other GilGoblin packages to calculate
profitability for in-game crafting in the game *FFXIV*.

The entire project, GilGoblin, can be viewed on Github:
