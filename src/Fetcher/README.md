## GilGoblin.Fetcher

`GilGoblin.Fetcher` is a package that can fetch data from third-party API's to update and populate the
database (`GilGoblin.Database`)

The batcher performs small operations on the input data but performs no other functionality. This package is
intended to be used in conjunction with other GilGoblin packages to calculate profitability for in-game
crafting in the game *FFXIV*.

The entire project, GilGoblin, can be viewed on Github:
