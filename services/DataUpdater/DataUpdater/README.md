## GilGoblin.DataUpdater

GilGoblin.DataUpdater is a package that updates the dynamic data for GilGoblin.Database.

An external call to third-party API's is performed and the resulting data is updated in the database.It mostly updates prices at
this time. 

The data updater package updates the database but performs no other functionality. This package is
intended to be used in conjunction with other GilGoblin packages to calculate profitability for in-game
crafting in the game *FFXIV*.

The entire project, GilGoblin, can be viewed on Github:
